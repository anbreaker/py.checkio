# You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second occurrence
# of the second string in the first one.

# Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence
# of "s" in a word "sims". Itâ€™s easy to find its first occurrence with a function
# index or find which will point out that "s" is the first symbol in a word "sims"
# and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0. But we have to find the
# second "s" which is 4th in a row and that means that the index of the second
# occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.

# Input: Two strings.

# Output: Int or None

# Example:

# second_index("sims", "s") == 3
# second_index("find the river", "e") == 12
# second_index("hi", " ") is None
